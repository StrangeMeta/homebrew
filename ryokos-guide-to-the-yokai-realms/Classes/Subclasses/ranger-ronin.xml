			<p class  =  "flavour">A flash of steel, like a conductor’s baton guiding a symphony of slaughter, heralds a helix of death and magic. A blur whips from tree to rock to shadow; corpses fall in its wake.</p>
            <p>The Ronin are masterless, wandering warriors, beholden to no code but their own. No two are the same, each with their own tale that led them down the warrior’s path. They are masters of many weapons, striking with blade and arrow in a spectacle of blinding speed and accuracy. Some Ronin use their power to protect the vulnerable—vigilantes doing what they see as right, no matter the cost. Others pursue their own ends, unfettered by the consequences of their actions. Ronin are dangerous combatants, hardened survivors, and above all things, free.</p>

			<p>You have mastered the art of striking with sudden, explosive power at any moment. The first time each turn that you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack using a weapon you drew that turn, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of that weapon’s type. This extra damage increases to 1d8 when you reach 11th level in this class.</p>

			<p>When a creature makes a weapon attack against you while you have a stowed melee weapon and a free hand, you can use your reaction to attempt to parry that blow, drawing your stowed weapon as you do so. Your AC increases by an amount equal to your Dexterity or Strength modifier (your choice) against that attack, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). After the attack hits or misses, you can then stow that weapon as a part of this reaction.</p>
