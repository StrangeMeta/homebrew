			<p>This wood and canvas glider transforms into a phoenix when thrown. It will travel 1d20+5 to the nearest 5 feat. Any creature in its path must make a Dexterity saving throw(DC: 10 + PB) or take 1d10+Con damage. Or half damage on a failed save. If the roll to throw is 1, the glider breaks on impact and must be repaired using 10GP of Canvas and wood.</p>

			<p>Royal Canesword

This canesword was presented to his Majesty High Arcohn Leidathus The 3rd over 150 years before Zephiri fell to the Omma. It was a gift from the northern Trade Federation in recognition of Zephiri's continuing favourable trade terms with them.</p>

<p>When attuned to this item you may as a bonus channel the noble power of those who have born the sword before. A number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest you may summon a past wielder who enters initiative until the end of your next turn.</p>
