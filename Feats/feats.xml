            <p>You have studied the meticulous movements and magical arts of element bending to the extent that you can channel crude but potent blasts of elemental energy through your body. When you select this feat, choose one damage type from among acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder. When you make an unarmed strike, you can choose for the strike to deal damage of that type equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>

            <p>You have acquired a portion of a bender’s connection to an element. Choose one of the four elements from the bender’s Elemental Affinity feature: air, earth, fire, or water. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul class = "unstyled">
                <li>You learn one cantrip and one 1st-level spell from the chosen element’s spell list. You can cast the 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).</li>
                <li>When you take this feat, choose one damage type associated with the element you chose. When you take damage of that type, you can use a reaction to gain resistance to that damage type, including the triggering damage, until the start of your next turn.</li>
