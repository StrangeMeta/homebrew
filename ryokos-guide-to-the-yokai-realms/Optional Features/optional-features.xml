            <p><i>5th-Level Barbarian Feature</i></p>
            <p>This feature replaces the Extra Attack feature and works with features that interact with Extra Attack.</p>
            <p class = "indent">You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
            <p class = "indent">When you reach 7th level in this class, the fury of your attacks can knock a foe to the ground. When you take the Attack action and make an attack roll against a creature with advantage, if both of the d20 rolls would hit the target, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, you can choose to knock the target prone or push it up to 5 feet away from you. Creatures more than one size larger than you automatically succeed on this saving throw. You can use this feature once per turn.</p>

            <p>When you reach 7th level in this class, your zealous righteousness can inspire or demoralise others. When you take the Attack action and hit with two attacks, you can use a bonus action to utter a battlecry, targeting one ally or enemy within 30 feet of you. If the target is a foe that can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your paladin spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If the target is an ally, the frightened condition ends on it. You can use this feature once per turn.</p>
