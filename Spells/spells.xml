            <p>You imbue a 20-foot-radius circle of ground you touch with an icey trap. The trap is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. When you cast the spell, choose a trigger:</p>

An affected creature ignores the effects of exhaustion, the poisoned condition, and cannot be incapacitated, stunned, paralysed, or fall unconscious.
