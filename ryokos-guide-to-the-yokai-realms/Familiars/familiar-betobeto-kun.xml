            <p>Much like their larger cousins, betobeto-kun delight in scaring unwitting creatures, drawing energy—as well as endless entertainment—from their startled yelps. Lacking the subtlety and patience to stalk their victims for prolonged periods of time as the betobeto-san do, however, these diminutive tricksters employ more rudimentary tactics. Betobeto-kun hide in the shadows, barely stifling their excited giggles, as they wait for the first passerby to jump out at, making noise and flopping their oversized tongues for a cheap fright. Crude as this strategy may be, betobeto-kun take great pride in their methods, and spend a lot of time practising their timing and thinking up strange new sounds to scare their victims.</p>
            <p class = "indent">If any of the betobeto-kun’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the betobeto-kun’s save DC, as calculated below</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + the betobeto-kun’s Charisma modifier.</p>
