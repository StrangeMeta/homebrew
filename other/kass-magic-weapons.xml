			<p>This canesword was presented to his Majesty High Arcohn Leidathus The 3rd over 150 years before Zephiri fell to the Omma. It was a gift from the northern Trade Federation in recognition of Zephiri's continuing favourable trade terms with them.</p>

			<p>When attuned to this item you may as a bonus channel the noble power of those who have born the sword before. A number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest you may summon a past wielder who enters initiative until the end of your next turn.</p>

			<p>This throwing knife comes in sets of five, and seems to have edges so sharply honed that it is unclear where they end and the surrounding air begins. Each knife deals damage as a thrown dagger, and contains one charge (1/long rest), which can be expended as a bonus action to teleport the wielder to its location. This teleportation is limited to a range of 90ft, and must target a knife in direct line of sight.</p>
