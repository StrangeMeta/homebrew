            <p>A bubble of temperate calm amongst a raging wildfire, a wedge of unmoving rock within a landslide, a shield of ice against fist-sized hailstones; you are a bulwark against the forces of nature, bending them to protect yourself and your allies. You understand that your role is not to crush and slaughter, but to preserve those around you that you may triumph together.</p>
            <p class = "indent">As a Disciple of Fortification, you may have taken a vow of pacifism yet still yearn for a life of danger and adventure. Perhaps you worked as a bodyguard, valuing the life of another more than your own. Maybe you found employment in a mine, saving colleagues from death by rock and explosives. Or it could be that your self preservation instincts are so well-honed that you cannot help but avoid catastrophe. Either way, the elements shield and fortify you from hurt and harm.</p>

            <p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you (including yourself) would take damage of a type associated with your Elemental Affinity, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage. The damage is reduced by 2d6 for each time you have chosen affinity with that element.
