                <description>When you reach 7th level in this class, the fury of your attacks can knock a foe to the ground. When you take the Attack action and make an attack roll against a creature with advantage, if both of the d20 rolls would hit the target, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, you can choose to knock the target prone or push it up to 5 feet away from you. Creatures more than one size larger than you automatically succeed on this saving throw. You can use this feature once per turn.</description>
