            <p class = "flavour">“There’s magic in this world that goes beyond flashes, bangs, and jets of flame. An earthy magic of food, structure, and fellowship. It’s the magic of a thousand mundane hands raising a city from velvet snow. A magic woven by walking into the cruellest, biting blizzard and welcoming it as your home. These people understand that magic. The mightest yokai and grandest kaiju might be able to survive here, for a time, but only the enkoh can thrive.”</p>
            <p class = "flavour">-Ryoko</p>
            <p>Beneath snow-capped peaks, where white drifts bury the chaos of rocks and streams, the formidable enkoh make cities of ice and snow. Well-adapted to colder climes, these thick-furred simian folk blend an innate skill for survival with a piercing intelligence, making homes in inhospitable environments.</p>

            <h4>Community and Craftsmanship</h4>
            <p>Enkoh have a transformative effect on their environment, domesticating beasts, curtailing avalanches, and building sprawling towns. With singular intent, enkoh collaborate to form a unified community capable of raising a city from the icy wastes in a matter of months. Their realms can be found within vast glaciers and snowfields, boasting soul-soothing hot springs and serving steaming winter cider fermented inside the trunks of hibernating trees.</p>
            <p class = "indent">Few enkoh structures are ancient; the ephemeral nature of ice and slow creeping of glaciers means only those structures in the coldest, flattest expanses are over a few hundred years old. This transient nature leads enkoh to value their kith and kin—their troop—over any single location, and has made them masters of ice-crafting. With saw and skin, enkoh cut and melt ice just enough so that it forms solid bonds upon re-freezing. This method produces edifices of fantastical shapes; indeed, enkoh architecture is widely regarded as some of the most beautiful in the Yokai Realms by the few foreign eyes to have seen it.</p>

            <h4>Troops of Solitude</h4>
            <p>Masters of ice-craft, enkoh guard their crafting secrets fiercely and rarely trade anything more than the essentials with other races. Though it is rare for an enkoh to leave their troop, the lure of master crafters specialising in metal and stone, as well as tales of verdant, sprawling landscapes not cloaked in ice, can lead some into lives of adventure. Fewer still return to their troop, but those that do are warmly welcomed and can expect a peaceful old age in return for sharing the wisdom of their travels.</p>

            <h4>ENKOH TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As an enkoh, you have the following traits:</p>
            <p>
                <span class = "feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Intelligence score increases by 2.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Age. </span>An enkoh reaches maturity at 15 years of age and can live up to 80 years.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Creature Type. </span>You are a Humanoid.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Thick Fur. </span>You have resistance to cold damage.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Languages. </span>You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your GM agree is appropriate for your character.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Subrace. </span>There are two primary variants among the enkoh: hulking and springtail. On the whole, enkoh see little value in in the anthropological labels placed upon them by other races, living together in equality and peace. Choose one of these subraces.<br/>

            <p>Every bit as rugged, resolute, and unflinching as the frigid mountains they call home, hulking enkoh are known for their fierce, calculating minds and explosive physical strength. Rarely do hulking enkoh act swiftly; they prefer to assess, analyse, and contemplate before choosing a path. However, when moved to action, the mountains move with them.</p>
