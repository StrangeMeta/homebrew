			<p class  =  "flavour">A talented rogue knows how to be quiet. A master knows how to be very loud, very far away.</p>
            <p>The secrets of hanabi, alchemical fabrications that explode in dazzling arrays of light and sound, are some of the most well-guarded of any of the artificing guilds. However, no ship is entirely without leaks, and well-kept secrets fetch a high price. Whether from a jaded pyrotechnician, stolen formulae, or enough coin in the right hands, some enterprising individuals learn these clandestine secrets. Known as Tamaya, such rogues use the pseudo-magic of fireworks as weapons to supplement their gunpowder-fuelled toolbox, sending enemies spiraling into disarray and chaos. Using artifice and ingenuity, these masters of thunder, fire, and smoke prove true the old adage: sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

			<p>You have mastered the skill of crafting tiny orbs that, using natural chemicals and sophisticated mechanisms, can replicate magical effects: spellbombs. You have a unique resource you use to craft these bombs: hanabi points. You have a number of hanabi points equal to your rogue level, and you regain all expended points when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class = "indent">At the cost of gold, 10 minutes of work, and hanabi points, you can choose one spell from the Tamaya Spellbombs table and store its effects within an armed, nonmagical spellbomb. The amount of gold and number of hanabi points required to construct a spellbomb is shown in the Tamaya Spellbombs table. Spellbombs weigh 1/2 pound, and any you craft that have not detonated disintegrate harmlessly when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class = "indent">A creature can use its bonus action to throw a spellbomb up to 60 feet. They are harmless unless detonated. You can use a reaction to detonate a spellbomb that you created whenever it is within 60 feet of you. When a spellbomb detonates, the spell contained within comes into effect, centred on the point at which the spellbomb detonated. If that spell requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration or until it is dispelled.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Spellbomb Ability. </strong>Intelligence is your ability for your spellbombs. You use your Intelligence whenever a spellbomb’s effect refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spellbomb you detonate.</p>

			<p>You are adept at using sound, light, and smoke to get the drop on your enemies. As a bonus action, or as a reaction when a creature rolls initiative, you can throw out a disorienting barrage of flashbangs and smoke at a point within 60 feet of you. Creatures of your choice within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellbomb save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes a -10 penalty to that initiative roll, or the next initiative roll it makes within the next minute. The creature’s current initiative does not change. On a successful save, the creature takes a -5 penalty instead.</p>

			<p>As an action, you can expend 3 hanabi points to set and conceal a special explosive spellbomb either upon a surface (such as a table, a section of floor, or a wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or a chest). The spellbomb is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) to be found. You decide what triggers the bomb to detonate when you create it. Typical triggers include touching or standing on the bomb, removing an object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of the bomb, or manipulating the object that holds the bomb.</p>
            <p class = "indent">You can further refine the trigger so the bomb detonates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature type or kind (for example, the bomb could be set to detonate in the presence of Aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can designate a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus to not trigger the bomb under these circumstances when you set it.</p>
            <p class = "indent">When triggered, the spellbomb detonates with deafening force in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spellbomb save DC. A creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and 6d6 acid, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice when you set the spellbomb) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
