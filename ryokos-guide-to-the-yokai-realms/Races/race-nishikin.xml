        <description>
            <p class = "flavour">To be filled in.</p>
            <p>Along the lowland, nutrient-rich lakes and bubbling freshwater streams that branch throughout the Yokai Realms, two races of aquatic beings make a home in harmony, the nishikins and ryujin. Nishikins are the hardy, bipedal, industrious fish-folk of this pair, renowned for their colourful, moon-blessed scales and powerful builds. With a meticulously charted history that stretches across aeons, the nishikins’ ancestors are said to be the seed from which all dragons and dragon-folk sprung forth into the world.</p>

            <h4>Slumbering Dragon</h4>
            <p>All nishikins possess a roiling heart of warmth and power within. Usually, this inner strength acts invisibly, a well of energy that drives a nishikin onwards with incredible longevity and vitality. In moments of great endeavour, however, the slumbering dragon awakens and briefly manifests as a tangible ally and guide. On rare occasions, nishikins who undergo transformative experiences of great euphoria or tragedy can even metamorphose into an actual dragon: a ryujin. This transformation is not a certainty; many nishikins never metamorphose, but for those that do, it is accompanied by a change in perspective and mindset—an evolution of outlook as well as form.</p>

            <h4>Restless Ambition</h4>
            <p>The diligence of the nishikins is legendary, their history overflowing with tales of explorers, hunters, crafters, and teachers who dedicated their lives to their pursuits. Nishikins hurl themselves into new experiences, dangers, and passions with alarming fervour, rarely entertaining more than one pursuit at a time and focusing solely on its mastery before moving on. The life of a nishikin is often an exhausting one, an endless trail of passion and dedication, and from birth until death, nishikins struggle to tolerate rest or relaxation for any length of time.</p>

            <h4>NISHIKIN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a nishikin, you have the following traits:</p>
            <p>
                <span class = "feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Age. </span>Nishikins mature rapidly, reaching adulthood by the age of 14. They go on to live for about two centuries.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Size. </span>You are Medium. Nishikins stand between 4 and 5 feet tall.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Speed. </span>Your walking speed is 30 feet.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Creature Type. </span>You are a Humanoid.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Amphibious</span>You can breather in both air and water.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Moonblessed. </span>While bathed in moonlight, you can use a bonus action to spend a number of your Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus. Roll those dice and add your Constitution modifier; you regain hit points equal to the total. If this healing restores your hit points to maximum, any surplus healing is gained as temporary hit points. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Nishikin Colour. </span>Each nishikin is born with its own unique colouration. In nishikin folktales, one’s primary colouration holds special significance. Your primary colouration also impacts your Slumbering Dragon trait and is associated with a specific ability score.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Powerful Build. </span>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Slippery. </span>You have advantage on ability checks or saving throws made to avoid or end the grappled condition on yourself.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Slumbering Dragon. </span>You can draw upon the bubbling energy you carry within to empower yourself. When you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw using the ability associated with your primary colouration, you can use your reaction to add 1d4 to the roll. You can use this reaction after rolling the d20, but must decide before the outcome is determined. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Draconic Metamorphosis. </span>When you reach 7th level, or when you undergo a significant moment of personal achievement or loss (at the GM’s discretion), you can choose to metamorphose into a ryujin. Your level, class, and other game statistics remain the same, aside from your race. You replace your racial traits from this race with those of the ryujin, and your ryujin colour is the same as your nishikin primary colouration. This transformation is one-way and can’t be reversed by any means short of a wish spell.<br/>
                <span class = "feature">Languages. </span>You can speak, read, and write Common and Aquan.<br/>
