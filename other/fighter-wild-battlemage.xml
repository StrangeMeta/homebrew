		<description>
			<p>Many magical societies employ bladesingers or eldritch knights as their frontline champions, but such societies leak magic into the land and rivers like a contagion, and it is not uncommon for children to be born in such places with minor sorcerous abilities that do not require such dedicated study.</p>
            <p>Whether natural born or created through experimentation, a wild battlemage has learned to harness a wellspring of chaotic magic within themselves unleashing it upon the battlefield in a variety of dazzling and confusing effects.</p>
