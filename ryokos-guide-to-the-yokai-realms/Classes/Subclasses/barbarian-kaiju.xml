            <p>The Path of the Kaiju is one of sheer destructive force. Some warriors of this kind are fueled by a relentless hatred of a kaiju, perhaps one that destroyed their home or ravaged their continent. In such cases, an individual’s burning obsession is a source of incredible strength, manifesting as an aspect of the kaiju’s own power in moments of blind rage. Other barbarians might worship kaiju for their strength and grandeur, calling on their aid in battle, embodying the might and fury of a colossus as they charge into the fray.</p>

            <p>When you adopt this path, choose a kaiju through which you draw power and gain the associated benefit from the options below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Ascendent Dragon. </strong>While raging, you can use an action to let loose a devastating blast of radiant energy from your mouth. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking a number of d6s radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
                <li><strong>The Eternal Leviathon. </strong>When you enter your rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can bellow an echoing cry. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or have disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than you until the start of your next turn.</li>
                <li><strong>The Titan Earth. </strong>You can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks. These strikes are still considered Strength-based attack rolls for the purposes of your other barbarian features.</li>
                <li><strong>The Armoured Kabuto. </strong>While raging, if you move at least 15 feet straight towards a target and then immediately hit it with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage from the attack.</li>
                <li><strong>The Infinite Tempest. </strong>The first time each turn while raging that you hit a target with a melee attack roll, you deal 3 (1d6) lightning damage to each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target as lightning spirals out from the point of impact.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class = "indent">You can switch your chosen kaiju each time you gain a new barbarian level.</p>

            <br></br>
            <p><strong>At 10th level. </strong>While raging, you and any objects you are wearing or carrying assume a pseudo-liquid form. In this form, you have resistance to fire damage, you are immune to the grappled and restrained conditions, you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet, you can move through other creatures’ spaces and through gaps as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing (but you can’t stop there), and you gain the benefits of half cover while submerged in water.</p>
