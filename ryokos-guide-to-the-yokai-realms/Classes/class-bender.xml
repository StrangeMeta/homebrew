        <description>
            <p>Bare, clawed feet part river-rounded gravel as a tengu sweeps through motions as graceful as any dancer’s, the surging water parting to allow her and her weary companions a peaceful crossing.</p>
            <p class = "indent">With patient composure, an oniborne deflects a hail of flaming arrows, redirecting their heat into a cascade of blue flame and burning fists.</p>
            <p class = "indent">The clack of jagged obsidian, splash of glacial water, and warmth of flaming eddies gather within a rushing whirlwind. Drifting out of these massed elements is a glowing atatsu; a primordial incarnation of their mortal form.</p>
            <p class = "indent">These benders, as disparate as their affinities might be, are defined by their connection with the elements: a magic manifested through precise and practised movements. More than a martial art, their motions are a spectacular union of magical and physical virtuosity, each twist and flick a nuanced touch of the Weave. For some, this is a weapon of war, of thunderclaps and fists of rock. For others, this is a tool to preserve, to craft shields of ice and invigorate with an inner flame. Whether a bender chooses to study all the elements—earth, air, water, and fire—or to master just one, the primordial forces of nature are theirs to command.</p>
            <h4>QUICK BUILD</h4>
            <p>You can make a bender quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in the ability you choose for your spellcasting: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the elementalist background.</p>

        <description>
            <p><em>1st-level bender feature</em></p>
            <p>As a bender of elements, you use the motions of your corporeal form to coax the Weave into manipulating the primordial forces.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from your bender spell list (see Elemental Affinity). At higher levels, you learn additional cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bender table. Your Elemental Affinity feature also allows you to learn more cantrips at higher levels.</p>
            <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
            <p>The Bender table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bender spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class = "indent">You prepare the repertoire of bender spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from your bender spell list (see Elemental Affinity). When you do so, choose a number of these spells equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier + half your bender level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class = "indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level bender, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a spellcasting ability of 14, your repertoire of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your repertoire of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class = "indent">You can change your repertoire of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new repertoire of bender spells requires time spent practising their movements and gestures: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell in your repertoire.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>When you gain your first level in this class, you choose which spellcasting ability you use for your bender spells from Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You use this ability whenever a bender spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use this ability’s modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bender spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p>You can cast a bender spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>You can use your free hand as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells. This free hand can be used for both the somatic and material components for a spell, provided the material component has no cost and isn’t consumed by the casting.</p>
