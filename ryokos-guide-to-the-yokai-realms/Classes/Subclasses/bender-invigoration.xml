        <description>
            <p>A rock suddenly lowers, dropping an ally a crucial inch and turning a critical hit into a glancing blow. A precise gust of wind accelerates an arrow over a foe’s shield, striking them in the eye. A burst of flame temporarily blinds an opponent, causing their battleaxe to swing wide. Where others shield and strike, Disciples of Invigoration prefer a more subtle approach, bolstering an ally from within or manipulating a foe’s attacks with alacritous and shrewd bursts of elemental energy.</p>
            <p class = "indent">Why did you choose this path? Did you always have a helpful disposition? Were you an aide de camp in a large army? A wizard’s apprentice that wandered into an elemental experiment? Whatever your choice, you are the favourable wind that stops a friend falling, the slick rock that foils a foe’s footing, and the inner flame that turns the tide of battle.</p>

            <p>With shrewd timing, you imbue an ally with invigorating energy. When a willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw or misses an attack roll, you can use your reaction to give it a rejuvenating boost. It immediately rerolls the saving throw or attack roll, with an additional bonus equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier, and it must use the new result, potentially turning a failed save into a success or a missed attack into a hit. If this rerolled attack hits, it deals damage of a type associated with one of your Elemental Affinities (your choice when you take the reaction) equal to your bender spellcasting ability.</p>
