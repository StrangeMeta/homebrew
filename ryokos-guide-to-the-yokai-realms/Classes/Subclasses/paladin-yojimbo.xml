			<p class  =  "flavour">“I don’t know the end to my story, but I can promise that you’ll live to see it."</p>
            <p>Yojimbo are sworn to protect those to whom they dedicate their service, be it an individual, a group, or an entire nation. Though Yojimbo typically pledge their allegiance to a charge and accompany them until death, a defenceless soul might find the raking claws of a dodomeki halted inches from their face by the serendipitous intervention of a wandering Yojimbo paladin. These roaming saviours traverse the realms on an unrelenting quest to shield those who can’t protect themselves. Despite being in high demand—unshakeable loyalty is a coveted virtue—Yojimbo rarely pledge themselves to the wealthy or powerful. It’s said that a true Yojimbo has the value of ten sellswords in battle, and ten-thousand sellswords in spirit.</p>
            <h5 class  =  "caption">TENETS OF THE YOJIMBO</h5>
            <p>The tenets of the Oath of the Yojimbo are unflinchingly resolute. They do not change or vary, no matter who a paladin pledges to protect.</p>
			<p class = "indent"><b><i>Protection.</i></b> Be a shield to those who lack a shield of their own. Be the weapon that meets the blade of those who would slaughter the weaponless.</p>
			<p class = "indent"><b><i>Strength.</i></b> Grow strong, for the sake of those who cannot. To shelter the vulnerable, one must have the power to hold back the storm.</p>
			<p class = "indent"><b><i>Inspiration.</i></b> Nurture the weak. Do not merely preserve the vulnerable; raise them up to be strong, so they might in turn protect others.</p>
			<p class = "indent"><b><i>Self-Sacrifice.</i></b> Wager everything for the safety of those who cannot fight. Nothing less is acceptable in the defence against tyranny.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain the following Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
			<p class = "indent"><b><i>Holy Ward.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity to perform a 1-minute divine ritual of protection, dedicating yourself to the service of a willing creature that stays within 30 feet of you during the entire ritual. The target becomes your ward for the next 24 hours, until you use this feature again, or until it dies. For the duration, your ward is immune to the frightened condition while you are conscious and within 60 feet of it. In addition, when your ward hits an enemy you can see with a weapon attack while within 60 feet of you, you can use a reaction and expend one spell slot to cause the attack to deal extra radiant damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.</p>
			<p class = "indent"><b><i>Guardian's Intervention.</i></b> As a reaction, you can use your Channel Divinity to reduce the damage dealt by an attack to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the damage the creature takes is reduced by a number of d10s equal to half your paladin level. If this feature reduces that damage to 0, the creature you protected can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack against the creature that attacked it.</p>
