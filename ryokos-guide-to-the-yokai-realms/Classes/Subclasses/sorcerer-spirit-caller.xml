			<p class  =  "flavour">Do you ever wonder what you’re worth? How strong you really are, deep down? What if others could glimpse your soul? Would they cower at your strength? They cower at mine.</p>
            <p>Legends tell that a Spirit Caller is born when the soul of a yokai and humanoid meet in the misty void that holds minds waiting to be given life. Spirit Callers are able to manifest their willpower and vitality as a spectral being, a wraith-like spirit that emerges from their body to strike at their enemies. The bond between Caller and spirit is visceral; in response to its Caller’s fury, a spirit might detonate a blast of necrotic energy, magnify its size, or hone its senses. A Spirit Caller is the epitome of self-reliance and personal strength, their soul and willpower manifested as a being of its own.</p>

			<p>You can use an action to manifest your spirit, which appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. It uses the Manifested Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You decide the appearance your manifested spirit takes. For example, your spirit might appear as a shadowy clone of you, a vicious dragon, or a mighty, sword-wielding specter that crackles with fiery energy. No matter the form your spirit takes, its statistics remain the same.</p>
            <p class = "indent">While manifested, your spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. As a bonus action, you can command it to take the Attack action on its next turn; otherwise, it takes the Dodge or Help action (your choice). Your spirit remains manifested for 10 minutes, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you lose your concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. After this time, your spirit retreats back into you and disappears.</p>
            <p class = "indent">You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
