		<description>
            <p>A favoured subject among poets and thespians across the realms is the tale of Ashura: the three-faced, six-armed demon god of destruction cast down from the heavens by the deities he offended. While the legend of Ashura might end there, his legacy and demonic power endure. Stories shared in hushed, fireside whispers tell of mighty Fiends that befoul the land—creatures echoing the form and power of the defeated demon god. On a path fueled by zealous passion and hate-driven vengeance, they cleave down everything in their way. The original Ashura may be gone, but the aspects of Ashura carry his legacy into the mortal world.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Fragment of Fury. </strong>Aeons ago, upon his defeat, Ashura was broken and scattered to different parts of the world, his power contained and fragmented. Over the centuries, however, like the creeping rust that shatters iron chains, time has weakened these seals, and aspects of Ashura have manifested across the realms. While a mere echo of the true Ashura, these creatures are deadly and cunning, inheriting fearsome magic, deadly battle prowess, and a burning wrath.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Blood and Lust. </strong>Similar to the original Ashura, the aspects are creatures whose body and mind are set ablaze by the most intense emotions one could feel. Happiness is experienced as nothing less than dizzying ecstasy, anger as nothing less than blinding rage. When met in battle, there is no hope of mercy, surrender, or compromise, and only death can stop them.</p>

				<li><strong><em>Critical Wound.</em></strong> When the aspect hits a creature with six or more attack rolls on a single turn, that creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 11 (1d8 + 7). This reduction can’t be undone by any means short of a wish spell.</li>
                <p></p>

                <li><strong><em>Goad.</em></strong> When a creature the aspect can see misses an attack roll or fails an ability check or saving throw, the aspect hurls a magically infused insult at that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or use its reaction to move its speed toward the aspect. If a creature moves within 5 feet of the aspect in this way, it can make one melee weapon attack against the aspect as a part of its reaction.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong><em>Spell Swallow.</em></strong> When a creature the aspect can see within 120 feet of it casts a spell, the aspect attempts to duplicate that magic for itself. The creature must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the spell is cast as usual, but the aspect also casts that same spell as a part of this reaction.</li>

		<description>
            <p>A crowd erupts in cheers as a group of students dash by on a track, each desperately sprinting forward, hellbent on outrunning the rest. As they round the final turn, a girl wearing a pair of shoddy-looking sandals pulls ahead, moving with a nimbleness and speed that onlookers could swear she did not previously possess. Later, in secret, after taking home a gleaming trophy, the girl removes her footwear and thanks them quietly, extending a handful of straw. A single eye opens up on each sandal, and a pair of bakezōri reveal themselves, grinning with delight as they take a meal from their human friend.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Preferential Possession. </strong>As a subspecies of tsukumogami—spirits that like to possess inanimate objects—thebakezōri are unusual in that they exclusively seek out footwear to inhabit. Like most tsukumogami, they are most attracted to objects that have gone through an interesting life of their own; it is common for a pair of bakezōri to settle themselves in frayed, damaged sandals. As with all sentient creatures, however, they are known to have idiosyncrasies and preferences and can be convinced to possess a new, shiny piece of footwear at the behest of a friendly adventurer.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Urban Yokai. </strong>Bakezōri are among the most common yokai for average Humanoids to encounter and are viewed as pests rather than outright threats. They tend to gravitate toward larger communities due to their possession preferences but prefer to remain hidden from the eyes of strangers, indistinguishable from a ruined sandal while resting by the side of the road.</p>

The bakezōri can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. While attached to a creature in this way, the bakezōri has advantage on attack rolls against the creature, moves with the creature, can’t attack other creatures, and the creature’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. The creature can use an action to make a DC 11 Strength check, removing the bakezōri on a success, where it lands prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature.</li>

		<description>
            <p>Among the ranks of city-dwelling yokai, the mischievous betobeto-san is one of paradoxical reputation—simultaneously infamous for inspiring fear in the hearts of those who encounter it, yet well-loved by locals as a playful, prankster spirit. Most of the time, the betobeto-san is invisible, but should one choose to reveal itself, onlookers are greeted with the sight of a round, ball-like creature with a grinning maw and two small legs. It is known to enjoy wearing sandals, with the tell-tale echo of invisible feet pitter-pattering over cobbled stone a sure indication that the betobeto-san is near.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>One Step at a Time. </strong>The betobeto-san is nocturnal, emerging from its hidden nest to roam the empty streets after most citizens have gone to sleep. Every city has stragglers, transients, and hooligans who walk the town at night, making perfect prey for the knavish yokai. The betobeto-san  follows closely behind its quarry, its footsteps echoing into the darkness, but when its victim turns to look, they find themselves to be seemingly alone. Isolated in the darkness and haunted by echoing footsteps, victims grow increasingly fearful—a fear that the betobeto-san is eager to exacerbate; fear is its prize.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Scary Sustenance. </strong>Betobeto-san sustain themselves on a diet of fear, but unless the impish yokai wishes it, their prey is not truly harmed in this process. In fact, their ability to devour fright has become revered by civilians and adventurers alike, with some attempting to tame and train betobeto-san to aid in soothing the emotions of those suffering from extreme stress and nightmares. However, in communities where fear is an ever-present spectre, perhaps under the reign of a cruel tyrant or in times of famine and war, these small yokai become corrupted by the persistent atmosphere of dread. Such betobeto-san grow huge as they feast aggressively and without caution, devouring a portion of their victims’ souls in the process. These betobeto-sama are cruel and dangerous, their mere presence perpetuating the dread that birthed them within desperate, haunted communities.</p>

            <p>Greed incarnate, the dodomeki are covetous, fiendish yokai infatuated with wealth and thievery. They take a distorted, humanoid form, with flesh covered in twitching, bulging eyes as black as a starless night. Their arms are grotesquely extended, their hair grows long and dark, and their grasping claws are vicious and swift.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Deadly Treasure Hunters. </strong>Dodomeki stalk those who radiate the stench of affluence, which dodomeki detect as a sickly, sweet aroma. Cloaked by invisibility and aided by a supernatural stealth, they brazenly pick the pockets of nobles in broad daylight, retreating before their theft is detected. Should a wealthy merchant or courier with an expensive cargo be caught alone, a dodomeki will reveal itself, reveling in cruel slaughter before meticulously stripping the corpse of all valuable possessions.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Insatiable Avarice. </strong>Devourers of treasure, dodomeki do not keep hordes as dragons do.

		<description>
            <p>A band of inquisitive boys crawl under hedgerows and over fences beyond a long-abandoned track road leading out of town, ignoring the flaking, painted warning signs plastered over along the road. As they heedlessly traipse across an abandoned rice field of mud and wilted plants, the earth suddenly shifts beneath them. In horror, the trespassers stand transfixed as a humanoid figure rises from the muck, coated in soil and withered vines, its three fingers pointing accusingly at the intruders. Only upon coming face to face with the slouching, decrepit form of the dorotabō do the interlopers realise the folly of insatiable curiosity.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Product of Hardwork. </strong>Akin to the onryō, dorotabō are vengeful spirits borne of the intense anguish of the dead. Unlike onryō however, who were warriors in life, dorotabō were once common farmers. When a field is desecrated by damage or neglect after the passing of its caretaker, the spirit of the one who once toiled so dutifully there becomes corrupted with anger and malice, transforming into a dorotabō, now cursed to haunt the land they once loved.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Tied to the Land. </strong>Dorotabō are intimately tied to their land; they are unwilling—and unable—to step foot outside of its borders. Within their territory, they are able to manipulate the earth itself, conjuring decay-ridden plants to entangle trespassers and bury them among the other foolish dead. They are grim guardians, and their domination is absolute across their tiny kingdom, for who can know the land better than the farmer it once belonged to?</p>

            <h5>Ebizo</h5>
            <p>Far beneath roiling ocean waves, in pitch darkness and numbing cold, only the hardiest and most tenacious life forms endure. The Ebizo, a society of dangerous crustacean yokai, are notorious for their raids on coastal towns and the plundering of ships foolhardy enough to stray into their ocean territory. According to legend, in aeons past, they were once isetsu who threw off the shackles of divine imperative, forsaking their post on land and stepping willingly into the ocean’s embrace. There, beneath the crushing pressure of ten-thousand fathoms, their shells and hearts hardened in the deep, endless dark. If the tales of their origin hold true, the irony is not lost on the isetsu; these ancient cousins, who abandoned their roles as guardians of the shoreline, have become monstrous yokai, chief among its greatest threats.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Current Affairs. </strong>Despite their clunky, encumbered appearance, none can navigate riptides and ride currents quite like the Ebizo—reading and sensing the flow of the water with a precision reminiscent of a hawk gliding on an updraft. While uncontested combatants in water, they are still formidable and ferocious on land, carrying the power and tenacity of the ocean wherever they tread.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Society. </strong>Contrary to the stories told by landfolk, to whom the Ebizo are naught but bloodthirsty pirates and conquerors, Ebizo society is rich and complex. The primary yokai of the clan are ebi’ishi, kanibozu, and zuwai, each with distinct talents and cultural importance. Although much of Ebizo society is crafted around oceanic conquest and battles with landfolk, they also engage in festivals, art, religion, and industry. Ebizo are intelligent and articulate, capable of reason and compromise, and, while undoubtedly deadly and aggressive, aren’t devoid of kindness and mercy.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Ebi'Ishi</h4>
            <p>The bulk of the Ebizo clan’s warriors are ebi’ishi—hardy lobster yokai with natural carapaces as durable as lacquered armour. Their roles range from city guards to infantry soldiers, while elder ebi’ishi serve as elite juggernauts tasked with the defence of zuwai. With experience comes strength and wisdom, an adage that rings particularly true among the ebi’ishi, for they never cease growing. Over time, their shells and claws become increasingly thick and mighty, with elders bearing carapaces so dense they deflect weapons with the ease of waves breaking on rock. However, as their weight and strength increase, their mobility suffers. The ultimate fate of an ebi’ishi is for their carapace to grow so heavy that it crushes the flesh within. To collapse under the weight of one’s shell is seen as an honourable death for an otherwise unconquerable warrior of the Ebizo clan.</p>

            <p>The kanibozu are esteemed nobles that form the backbone of the Ebizo society, often acting as teachers, seers, historians, healers, and spies. These yokai have a particular affinity for illusion magic, with many legends told of kanibozu infiltrating isetsu outlooks disguised as roaming mercenaries or masquerading as priests within monasteries, dutifully playing their roles for decades before being caught. In their true form, every kanibozu carries a lantern—a focus through which they channel their magic and an immutable symbol of authority and status. In the haunting darkness and crushing depths of the ocean, the distant, eerie light of a kanibozu is a bolstering force of hope for the Ebizo and a stern warning to its enemies.</p>

            <p>The Ebizo believe that all things belong to the ocean, and the ocean belongs to the zuwai. Matriarchs among the Ebizo, these deep-sea elementalists tower over the rest of the clan, both in stature and magical prowess. Among their kin, zuwai act as chieftains and battlefield commanders, masterminding the flow of combat from afar and rarely engaging personally. However, should the need arise, zuwai are fearsome warriors innately equipped with lethal magic. Their grace in battle is unmatched; the zuwai’s many limbs move with spectacular synchronicity as they channel the element of water through precise movements—an uncanny union of delicate motion and crushing tidal force. In many ways, zuwai are the ocean’s erratic temperament incarnate, at one moment beautiful in tranquillity, the next terrifying in tempestuous rage.</p>

		<description>
            <p>Cavorting with the roaring wind and singing with every crash of thunder, a bundle of torn red cloth held together by a wooden frame dances through a darkened sky. It is a hone karakasa, joyous and unfettered by the rain and gale of a driving tempest. Resembling a torn-up umbrella with its bamboo skeleton exposed, this large and unusual tsukumogami is a sight that sends civilians scarpering indoors—but not to protect themselves from the hone karakasa itself. On days such as these, where the flying yokai is glimpsed in a distant sky, it acts as the harbinger of an oncoming storm. As such, the hone karakasa’s appearance is a useful sign to many Humanoids, albeit rarely a welcome one.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>A Bone to Pick. </strong>Tsukumogami are known to be a class of mischievous, playful yokai; sometimes troublesome, sometimes helpful, but rarely ever outright hostile; the exception is the hone karakasa. An elder tsukumogami whose great lifespan allows it to grow larger and stronger than its younger counterparts, this oversized umbrella is far more aggressive and belligerent than others of its kind. It subsists on a diet almost exclusively consisting of small animals, hunting under the cover of mighty storms, seizing prey spooked from their nests by flashes of lightning and rumbles of thunder. As opportunists, hone karakasa have been known to steal food from Humanoids as well, and eagerly strike up fights with whoever the wind brings them before.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Leader of the Flock. </strong>Because of their age, aggression, and relative strength, whenever tsukumogami gather, a hone karakasa often emerges as the leader of the band. They often fly at the head of a yokai parade, dancing high and free in a proud and beautiful display—their papery wings spread wide, inspiring awe in the gaggle of smaller tsukumogami stumbling in their wake.</p>

		<description>
            <p>Of all the fiendish yokai that prowl the land, few can match the cunning and ingenuity of the jorogumo: a shapeshifting spider-demon with a humanoid head and torso grotesquely perched atop the abdomen of a giant spider. Horror stories tell of quaint, luxurious roadside inns that seem to pop up out of nowhere, beckoning merchants and travellers alike with the promise of full bellies, soft sheets, and a charming host. Those foolish enough to be ensnared by these promises never return—stolen from their beds, wrapped up in sweet-scented silk, and dragged below the earth to the jorogumo’s lair. Here they are left, desperate and struggling, surrounded by the corpses of others caught by the demon yokai, their muffled screams meritless as they lie trapped in a dark, webbed tomb. Particularly sadistic jorogumo visit their prey, singing soft tales of lost love and fallen heroes, holding them in a tender caress, and revelling in the thrill of their victims’ absolute terror before devouring them utterly.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Living Form. </strong>The jorogumo’s most subtle art is that of shapeshifting, capable of assuming the form of a Humanoid and integrating among its prey. Some jorogumo spend years in plain sight, mimicking the lives and habits of ordinary townsfolk, accruing a kill count in the hundreds over decades of careful slaughter. To some jorogumo, this sickly Humanoid pantomime is as satisfying as the kill itself.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Empty Shell. </strong>The magic of the jorogumo’s form extends beyond mere shapeshifting. They must shed regularly as they grow, and this discarded shell of flesh and webbing holds magic of its own. It is a husk—a mindless, predatory shadow of the true jorogumo. While it possesses no malice, it is still extremely dangerous; jorogumo husks are driven only by a relentless, aching need to be whole once more. They burn with a yearning to consume—to wrap around another as a cocoon of flesh. Victims of jorogumo husks are consumed, enveloped by the ghastly undead and suspended within it. The husk and its slaughtered victim then undergo a metamorphosis, and a new jorogumo is born, able to shapeshift into the likeness of the creature the husk devoured.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Spider Arts. </strong>Jorogumo are consummate artists, exhibiting mastery across various crafts, including carpentry, artifice, song, and dance.

            <p class = "indent"><strong>Deadly Scavenger. </strong>Kamaitachi prefer to scavenge food, sneaking close to settlements and pilfering what they can under the cover of darkness.

            <p class = "flavour">They’re cruel, malevolent, and gleefully evil... So, pretty much your standard cat. —Ryoko</p>
            <p>Under the falling rain, a solemn funeral procession winds through a weary town. Two priests lead the parade, each bearing a pair of ceremonial cymbals. Each heavy step forward is met with a gentle knell—the ancient, ritual pulse of clashing bronze to ward off any evil spirit who might disrupt the tragic vigil. At such an event, no yokai is more feared than the ruthless kasha, a flaming feline monster with a penchant for stealing and devouring the dead. Unbeknownst to the grieving procession, in the deep shadows cast by a slowly fading sun, a steady hiss of steam whispers. It is the sound of rainwater boiling on contact with flame, as a ravenous yokai stalks its next meal.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Hell's Harvester. </strong>. Of all the yokai known, there are few reviled like the kasha. Their preferred source of food is carrion, but unlike other scavengers that happily feast on rotting flesh, kasha prefer their meals fresh—and Humanoid. More grotesque still, kasha have a sadistic love for dead things, often taking fresh corpses back to their lairs to skin, carve, and preserve.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Flaming Cart. </strong> While more than willing to stay patient and cunning while hunting, when threatened, a kasha’s body becomes wreathed in flames. Once discovered, it acts with extreme aggression—terrifying its victims with its flaming form and dashing around the battlefield. Such is their agility in this state that they are often likened to a flaming wagon barreling down a desolate track, unimpeded and at full speed.</p>

            <p>There exists a yokai whose deadliness is deceptive, whose appearance does not reflect the devastation it leaves in its tread. Long-limbed and tiger-striped, the korōri is a docile-looking creature most commonly found hiding inside tunnels and caves, scuttling away frantically at signs of danger. Despite its cowardice and unassuming presence, however, the korōri is deadly, producing a vicious poison that will lay an entire village to waste if allowed to settle.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Patient Predator. </strong>The korōri hunts by finding a secluded hiding place and lying in wait, curling up into a ball while opening stripe-like vents across its body. From these vents, a lethal, poisonous fume seeps into the area around it. The poison is odourless, almost impossible to detect until the sickness sets in. Some say the korōri reeks of death and decay, but this is inaccurate. The odour of rot that follows its arrival is the stench of living creatures around the korōri that fall prey to its deadly miasma. Only after it detects the scent of rotting flesh does the korōri emerge from its hiding place to feed.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Bringer of Illness. </strong>There is nary a creature more widely feared than this innocuous yokai. While kaiju can destroy cities in mere minutes, there is no Monstrosity, Fiend, or Fey that can lay waste to a populace in such a subtle and silent manner as the korōri. Its poison twists the mind and senses, inciting harrowing hallucinations and excruciating anguish before death, sparing none, even creatures typically immune to venoms and toxicants. The korōri is considered a harbinger of pestilence, a demon of plague and ruin, and a herald of death and rot by cultures from all corners of the realm. A single korōri footprint found on the outskirts of a town is grounds enough for the whole settlement to evacuate immediately.</p>

However, there is one exception—the narigama, a benevolent tsukumogami known for inhabiting well-used and well-loved iron kettles. Appearing as a fuzzy quadrupedal creature with a kettle as its head, the whimsical appearance and character of the narigama, its docile nature, and its valuable ability to predict the future, has endeared it to many folk across the realms.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Spilling the Tea. </strong>Despite a humble appearance, narigama are exceptionally sensitive to their environments and are able to sense minor changes in temperature and air pressure, detect nearly indistinguishable vibrations, and identify distant noises even the keenest Humanoids would be unable to detect. Priests and sailors often teach their narigama pets to make various clicks and whistles to signal information without speech. As a result, they can be trained to reliably predict almost anything, from coming storms to volcanic eruptions, from animal migrations to bandit incursions.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Boiling Hot. </strong>Narigama living in shrines, shipyards, and boats often lead a carefree, spoiled life—their caretakers offering them everything they desire in return for their predictions of the future. However, like most yokai, these fuzzy critters can still pose a threat if they feel threatened. If pressed, a narigama will raise its hackles, give a loud, ear-piercing whistle, and spew a stream of boiling water at its assailant from its kettle head.</p>

            <p>Adorning the walls of monasteries, alongside fearsome depictions of gods and mighty heroes, are renderings of gentle equine creatures known as ryume.

            <p class = "indent"><strong>Gifted Guardians. </strong>It is said that the ryume were the last of the great gifts imparted to the material world by the gods. They bore weary travellers and refugees on their backs, galloping over ocean and cloud to a land free from the ravages of war and kaiju.

            <p class = "indent"><strong>Peaceful Wanderers. </strong> Now, having outlived their mortal charges, the ryume wander the land, their elegant hooves careful never to trample even the smallest of innocent creatures.

		<description>
            <p>For many, pristine palaces of gleaming stone and resplendent glory are nothing compared to the charming, ramshackle homes of ordinary townsfolk. Each house has its unique quirks and charm, stacked side-by-side along winding city streets, brimming with life and character. Some yokai feel the same, seeking homes not in ornate statues or mighty trees, but in everyday, tattered objects—a perfect, cosy resting place. The lesser, playful yokai spirits who occupy such objects are the tsukumogami.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>A Playful Gang. </strong>Tsukumogami often gather for adventures of mischief and exploration. Under the cloak of twilight, a stray sandal, a crooked umbrella, and a shattered lantern might join forces for a night on the town. Despite being individually feeble spirits, the havock a swarm of possessed objects can cause while rampaging through a town is not to be underestimated. They enjoy “dancing” with humans, a terrifying experience for their unfortunate partner caught in a maelstrom of excitable footwear and umbrellas. Usually a victim is able to escape relatively unscathed, but those who cannot find themselves lifted bodily into the air and flown about town, the yokai confusing their passenger’s terrified shrieks for howls of delight. Generally, these victims are unceremoniously deposited atop a strangers roof when the swarm grows weary of them. Tsukumogami rarely attack other creatures unprovoked, but they are dangerous if threatened or frightened, and are best avoided if spotted at night.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Hyakki Yahyro Harbinger. </strong>Swarms of tsukumogami are often seen in the days preceding the parade of one thousand demons—the infamous Hyakki Yagyo. This ancient, annual tradition is one that requires extensive preparation, and Humanoids know well to heed the excitable behaviour of tsukumogami as a warning of mightier spirits coming. During the parade, tsukumogami enjoy possessing instruments and forming large, musical swarms at the head of the pack. Their ruckus is legendary; tsukumogami are famously as enthusiastic as they are incompetent when it comes to creating music.</p>

            <p>A hulking, tusked demigod with vibrant blue skin strides through a flooding village. Unfazed by the tumultuous current and driving torrential rain, it seizes person and livestock alike, lifts them above the water, and bears them to safety atop its mighty shoulders. Even as the storm rages, the creature works tirelessly to save any being trapped by the rising water. With the village in desperate peril and its inhabitants resigned to their fate, a taki reiō has come to answer the prayers and pleas of those in need.</p>

In battle, they are direct  and brutal, a stalwart combination of physical strength and water magic. Taki reiō are unwavering in their ideals and goals, and once moved to action, are as sure to accomplish their task as rain is to fall.</p>

An ancient guardian deity, unshakable in his crusade against evil, fragmented himself and spread across the land.

With sword in hand, each immovable giant stands vigilant under their waterfall, awaiting any sign of evil they must rise to vanquish.</p>

            <p>Out amongst the rocky crags of the coast, hidden beneath the gnarled fangs of sea-blasted cliffs are a species of yokai feared for their aggression and cunning—ox-headed, spider-bodied demons: the ushi-oni. Well known to fisherman, pirates, and coastal communities, these savage yokai haunt the nightmares of any who live beside the waves.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Macabre Mimicry. </strong>Despite their hulking, monstrous appearance, the ushi-oni is a creeping, stealthy hunter; its thick, rugged exoskeleton is perfectly coloured and textured to match its craggy home. Once coiled over, it is indistinguishable from a coastal boulder. They are also uncanny vocal mimics. Despite lacking the capacity to replicate the precise, delicate articulations needed for speech, ushi-oni are able to recreate the cries and wails of Humanoid adults and infants, hoping to lure foolhardy rescuers to them as an easy meal.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Artificial Anchor. </strong>Beyond their talents in mimicry and camouflage, ushi-oni also exude a unique poison that seeps through the salty sea air, devastating nearby creatures. The poison itself isn’t directly fatal, but is a subtle and cruel paralysing agent that burrows into a victim’s body and saps its strength. A creature exposed to the poison will eventually fall, rooted in place by the overbearing, strangling weight of its own body—easy pickings for the savage yokai.</p>

They bolt over the long, winding tracks of the countryside, sprinting hell-for-leather in pursuit of solitary prey.

            <p>Amidst the howling winds of a deadly blizzard, a humanoid figure strides atop the snow, their steps as light and graceful as a leaf resting on water. Their skin and hair glisten with white, crackling frost. The landscape is marked with statues of once-living creatures—flash-frozen, encased, and preserved forever in ice, and yet the individual strides onward, unbothered by the climate or death that surrounds them. To the yuki no ko, the biting, icy chill is a gentle caress; what cold can bother a being who houses a piece of winter itself within?</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Frostbitten Legacy. </strong>The name yuki no ko refers not to one individual, but to a group of Elemental specialists who chose to isolate themselves in the coldest corners of the realm to hone their craft. They follow a path passed down to them by an ancient yuki onna, imbuing their ancestors with a shred of the snow yokai’s essence—the gift to endure and manipulate ice and snow. Whatever ties to kin or culture their forebears may once have had has long since been chiselled away by centuries of cold and darkness. With hearts icy to the tribulations of others and potent magic at their command, the once Humanoid yuki no ko are now winter yokai themselves.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Snow Spirit's Legacy. </strong>Although the gift of the yuki onna is great—the yuki no ko are impervious to the extreme climate of permafrost—it comes at heavy price; anything above freezing temperature is nigh unbearable for them, with prolonged exposure to heat lethally dangerous. As a result, these Elemental warriors are seldom found beyond the mountain peaks and tundras they call home, making them a rare sight reserved for the boldest explorers or most isolated enkoh villagers. It is said that their very presence will bring about a blizzard, but in reality, yuki no ko are the ones chasing the snowstorm.</p>

If a creature fails this save by 5 or more, it also gains 1 level of exhaustion.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong><em>Armour of Ice.</em></strong> The yuki no ko forms freezing, icy armour around a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The creature can make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, avoiding being encased in the armour on a success. When armoured in ice, a creature gains 13 (3d8) temporary hit points and takes 13 (3d8) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. This cold damage ignores temporary hit points, damaging the target’s hit points directly. The armour is destroyed when these temporary hit points are depleted or the Yuki no Ko dies. A creature immune to cold damage bearing this armour also has a +1 bonus to its AC and saving throws.</li>

		<description>
            <p>Well-travelled merchants and world-weary adventurers tell of a sinister spirit that makes its home amidst the freezing winds and eternal white of the mountain tops—a ghostly apparition that moves with unearthly grace, their silent steps leaving no imprint on the snow-covered land. While accounts of the encounter vary depending on the speaker, all share the common themes of dread and the chilling grasp of ice that saps all strength and hope. Even a whisper of the name yuki onna causes the breath behind the words to rise like white steam on a winter’s morning, and the mere mention of this creature is sufficient to send shivers down the spine of even the most battle-hardened warrior.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Snow-fallen Influence. </strong>Once upon a time, the yuki onna was far less malevolent—a winter yokai that drifted peacefully across isolated, beautiful lands of velvet snow. They shared secrets with Humanoids who sought knowledge, and they protected enkoh and other creatures that found homes in their desolate lands. But alas, when a catastrophic event now lost to time brought an icy and painful death to the many innocent souls that shared their frigid home, the restless spirits of the frozen dead became intertwined with the snow yokai’s being. The horror and pain transformed the yuki onna, giving birth to a ghastly yokai wraith that wanders the land as a harbinger of ice-cold death and anguish.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Cold Vengeance. </strong>After becoming infused with the restless souls of those who found an untimely, freezing demise, the yuki onna’s desires changed to reflect those of the dead. No longer concerned with merely watching over their domain, the wraith is now obsessed with seeking out any source of warmth and destroying it. All must give way to the cold and the dark. If the souls it carries were deprived of all warmth in their wretched death, why should others be allowed to have it?</p>

				<li><strong><em>Ice Prison.</em></strong> When the yuki onna deals cold damage to a creature, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to the cold damage dealt, as foul magic encases the target in a layer of ice.

		<description>
            <p>A favoured subject among poets and thespians across the realms is the tale of Ashura: the three-faced, six-armed demon god of destruction cast down from the heavens by the deities he offended. While the legend of Ashura might end there, his legacy and demonic power endure. Stories shared in hushed, fireside whispers tell of mighty Fiends that befoul the land—creatures echoing the form and power of the defeated demon god. On a path fueled by zealous passion and hate-driven vengeance, they cleave down everything in their way. The original Ashura may be gone, but the aspects of Ashura carry his legacy into the mortal world.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Fragment of Fury. </strong>Aeons ago, upon his defeat, Ashura was broken and scattered to different parts of the world, his power contained and fragmented. Over the centuries, however, like the creeping rust that shatters iron chains, time has weakened these seals, and aspects of Ashura have manifested across the realms. While a mere echo of the true Ashura, these creatures are deadly and cunning, inheriting fearsome magic, deadly battle prowess, and a burning wrath.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Blood and Lust. </strong>Similar to the original Ashura, the aspects are creatures whose body and mind are set ablaze by the most intense emotions one could feel. Happiness is experienced as nothing less than dizzying ecstasy, anger as nothing less than blinding rage. When met in battle, there is no hope of mercy, surrender, or compromise, and only death can stop them.</p>

                <li><strong><em>Goad.</em></strong> When a creature the aspect can see misses an attack roll or fails an ability check or saving throw, the aspect hurls a magically infused insult at that creature.
