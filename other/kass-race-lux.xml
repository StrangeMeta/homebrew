            <p class = "flavour">â€œThat's when I saw it. Tall as an oak, wiry like willow, leaning on a stave of shifting stone."</p>

            <h4>From Nature Wrought</h4>
            <p>The Lux are a new race to come to The Vale. None can say when they began to appear, not least The Lux themselves. They are tentatively accepted in many settlements, but always met with suspicion and fear.</p>
            <p class = "indent">The Lux embody a material originating from the natural world. Most are formed of living wood, but others may coalesce from fallen leaves, be rough-hewn from stone or even compose themselves from mud and wetland plants. These bodies - while often lacking in the way of physical resistance - are easily repaired and augmenting their forms with new materials from whatever location they find themselves. A Lux at play may create new 'hair' for themselves from braided reeds, or carve flowing patterns into the oak-bark of their forearms. In many cases, they appear fascinated with the idea of antlers, attaching those of deer carcasses to their heasds, or using delicate branches in their place. The only common feature between all Lux is their three eyes, two of which are used for vision. A Lux's third eye is rarely opened, and contains powerful magic within.</p>

            <h4>To Nature Returning</h4>
            <p>Upon death, The Lux return to inanimacy. The materials from which their bodies are composed return to a non-magical state, as whatever fleeting energies empowered their sentience merge once more into the world of the spirits. This process is often peaceful, regardless of the nature of their death, and many Lux lack real fear for their mortal forms, beyond the end to their time as living things. This casual attitude towards oblivio  sets them apart from other races, as they often struggle to comprehend the true finality of endings that others experience.</p>

            <h4>Curiosity in the Meantime</h4>
            <p>Whilst they may live, many Lux wish to experience the world. They are naturally suited to long periods of travel, and enjoy drinking in the culture and colours of a new place from a distance. This leads them to have an often trickter-esque place in the folklore of other races, as they rarelt interact without being approached, and prefer the carefree company of curious children to the often suspicious and fearful world of adults.</p>

            <h4>ENKOH TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a Lux, you have the following traits:</p>
