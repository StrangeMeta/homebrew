            <p>A bancho-gama’s respect is hard-earned, and its obedience even more so. In nature and in partnerships, these toad-like creatures prefer to be the ones in positions of authority, collecting ‘lackeys’ that they can boss around for their benefit. Their remarkable agility and skill in combat make them desirable companions for adventurers… but many find that those traits are not worth enduring the bancho-gama’s domineering behaviour. It takes a truly exceptional tamer to convince a bancho-gama to work together as equals, and many will gawk at the sight of these stubborn creatures receiving orders from another. Do you have what it takes?</p>
            <p class = "indent">If any of the bancho-gama’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the bancho-gama’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <p class = "indent"><strong>Save DC</strong> = 8 + {{proficiency}} + {{bancho-gama:cha:modifier}}</p>
