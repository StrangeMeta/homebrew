        <description>
            <p>Disciples of Ferocity traverse battlefields as a whirlwind of blades, fists, and elemental fury. Whether it be with the deadly patience of a stalking predator or the reckless abandon of a raging barbarian, these benders rely on an unflinching offence as the solution to that which stands in their way. They are students of devastation; armed and armoured, their movements embodying the destructive forces of nature: desolating wildfires, wrenching tornadoes, surging tsunamis, and rending earthquakes.</p>
            <p class = "indent">How did you come to follow such a path? Perhaps you were a mercenary exposed to primordial influences. Maybe you were a sailor, using wind and water to shorten sea voyages and protect your crew from pirates and raiders. Conversely, you may be an acolyte of pacifism, unleashing your destructive potential when fear overrides your better judgement. The choice is yours and the elements are your weapons.</p>

            <p>The following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, a guardian of faith may take the form of a giant stalagmite projecting spears of rock (earth affinity), or a storm cloud letting loose booms of thunder (air affinity).</p>
