            <p>You have entered into a pact with a shinigami, a fearsome spirit of the netherworld, with powers of death and possession. Shinigami themselves are beings of variable character, some playing active roles in the lives of their emissaries, others inscrutable and shrouded in mystery. All, however, serve a singular, ultimate purpose: to perpetuate death. Those who wield a shinigami’s power spin magic of shadow and authority, puppeteering objects, creatures, servants, and thralls. Such magic is as vicious and precise as it is hated and feared; even those with noble intent who enter into a shinigami’s pact become equal in terror to the evil they seek to vanquish.</p>

			<p>As an action, you can take control of a corpse or unconscious creature you can see within 60 feet of you for 1 minute or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The target must be Large or smaller and of a CR equal to or less than your warlock level (or the CR it had in life if it’s a corpse).

                <li>It can’t gain hit points or recover from the unconscious condition.</li>
                <li>It’s immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.</li>
                <li>It gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier plus five times your warlock level.</li>
